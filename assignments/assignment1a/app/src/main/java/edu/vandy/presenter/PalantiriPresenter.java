/**
 * This class manages the Palantiri simulation.  The simulation begins
 * in the start() method, which is called by the UI thread and is
 * provided a reference to the GazingSimulationActivity, which is used
 * to manipulate the UI.  The Options singleton contains the number of
 * beings to simulate and the number of palantiri to simulate.
 * 
 * The simulation should run as follows: the configured number of
 * palantiri should be instantiated and added to the PalantiriManager
 * in the Model layer.  A Java thread should be created for each
 * Being.  Each Being thread should attempt to acquire a palantir a
 * certain number of times.  As this is happening, Being threads
 * should call the appropriate methods in GazingSimulationActivity to
 * demonstrate which palantiri are being used and which Beings
 * currently own a palantir.
 *
 * This class plays the "Presenter" role in the Model-View-Presenter
 * (MVP) pattern by acting upon the Model and the View, i.e., it
 * retrieves data from the Model (e.g., PalantiriModel) and formats it
 * for display in the View (e.g., GazingSimulationActivity).
